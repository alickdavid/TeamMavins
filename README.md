# TeamMavins

As scheduled for the HNG Interns in the Front-end, Back-end and Design tracks, we are to create a working Sign-up and Login pages. 
The mock-up design and background was provided by the Design fellow, while the Front-end interns work on bringing it to live. The authorization was done with PHP by the back-end interns. 
Some little addition were included, which are as follows:
- Adding a sign-out function. 
- Creating a welcome dashboard for Logged in users. 
- A welcome text to indicate successful registration.
